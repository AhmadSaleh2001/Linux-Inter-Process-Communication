Shared memory, another of of communication between the processes
simply, reserve some memory, make it sharable
1. when to use it?
  a. when do we need high performance communication between different part of the system
  because it has direct memory access
    no need to copy data from user mode to kernel mode as AF_UNIX and message queues

2. several ways to achieve it:
  a. on memory
    i. by reserve some part of the memory and start writing into it
      1. we can configure it to be shared between processes and put some name into the shared memory
  b. on file
    i. we can select some file on the system (the size of it should be well known)
      for example 20MB
    ii. then we will map it into the memory to start writing to the by multiple processes
    iii. this technique avoid explicit file I/O by directly write into memory then
      the changes that are written into memory will be flushed into the file
    iv. use cases:
      1. when we have some external I/O resource like a printer
        and we need to write into it some data
