implement distributed transparent memory using UDP / TCP
we have master
the client send to master that he need to GET / PUT value of X
since we have large distributed memory, meaning we have many machines provide to
the master their RAM, so the master is responsible bu putting the data in the correct machine
each machine we have, either forward the request to another machine if the value
not exist on it or return it if its exists

Keywords:
1. Hashing
2. Forwarding requests

Client communicate with master machine using TCP
master machine communicate with the cluster of nodes using UDP for efficiency
we will assume for each spined up node the following:
1. his TCP port is the entered by the user
2. his UDP port is (the entered by the user + 2000)


Follow up:
we can implement something like consistent hashing using this project
