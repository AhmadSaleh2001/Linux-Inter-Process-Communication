Extending the functionality of the project IP Routing table
by support sending ARP requests between the processes
the difference here, we will store ARP table into shared memory file
using mmap

lets assume we have master process (act as a router)
and another processes act as a clients

when we have new entry added to the routing table
we need to synchronized it among the clients
