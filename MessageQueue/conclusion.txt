Message queues
another way of communication in linux
the difference between them and the sockets that:
1. easier for handling
2. async processing
3. Higher overhead due kernel management
  a. because data copying from user mode to the kernel mode (to the queue)
  b. multiple context switches
4. persist data direct into file, while Unix sockets faster by keep them saved in memory
